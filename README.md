# AdventureWorks Analysis

### Project Overview

I used Microsoft SQL Server and Power BI Desktop to create a report using Microsoft's AdventureWorks sample database. My goal was to create an in-depth report that utilized as many different Power BI techniques as possible to showcase my abilities to both explore and visualize data.

### Data Sources

AdventureWorks2019: The AdventureWorks databases are sample databases that were originally published by Microsoft to show how to design a SQL Server database using SQL Server.
